TP1 Edit History

- Created graphics. This includes setting up all the modes in the game, including:
	- title screen, "new game" and "instructions" features accessible, has image
	- character selection screen, not set up because classes aren't ready
	- instructions, not written out but that's easy; has back button
	- game mode, has limited scrolling area, has image, needs a lot of work!
	- controls screen, comes up in game when you press 'c'
	- death screen, since there is no player, currently pressing 'n' to "die"

Most things that I've done so far are setting up for inserting features into the game.
I feel like it's hard to create features without having a framework to put it in first.
Checklist includes creating, spawning, and having functional enemies, as well as making
the player and bullets work. After that it'll just be small features like saving and quitting,
and improving and replacing all the graphics. I'm planning on making my own if I don't find
consistent ones that work with my map.
